Exercise 10.38: List the five iterator categories and the operations that each
supports.

Answer:
From Table 10.5 (p.410)
1) Input iterator
        Read, but not write, single-pass, increment only
2) Output iterator
        Write, but not read, singe-pass, increment only
3) Forward iterator
        Read, write, multi-pass, increment only
4) Bidirectional iterator
        Read, write, multi-pass, increment and decrement
5) Random-access iterator
        Read, write, multi-pass, full iterator arithmetic
