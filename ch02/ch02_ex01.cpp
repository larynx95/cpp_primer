Exercise 2.1: What are the differences between int, long, long long,
and short? Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and
a double?

Answer:
C++ guarantees short and int is at least 16 bits,
                        long    at least 32 bits,
                   long long    at least 64 bits.
