Exercise 2.19: Explain the key differences between pointers and references.

Answer
A pointer
- is an object whose value is the adress of another object.
- declared, but can be initialized later
- value can be changed

A reference
- is not an object.
- It is an alias of another object.
- declared, and should be initialized simultaneously
