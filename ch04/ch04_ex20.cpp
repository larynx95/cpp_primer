Chapter 04. Expressions

Exercise 4.20: Assuming that iter is a vector<string>::iterator,
indicate which, if any, of the following expressions are legal. Explain the
behavior of the legal expressions and why those that arenâ€™t legal are in error.
(a) *iter++;
(b) (*iter)++;
(c) *iter.empty()
(d) iter->empty();
(e) ++*iter;
(f) iter++->empty();

Answer:

(a) *iter++; is legal. The expression moves iter to point to the next element
and returns the value of the original element.

(b) (*iter)++ is not legal. The expression means increasing value of the
element, but the value is a string and string does not have ++ operator.

(c) *iter.empty() is not legal. Because iter is an iterator and has no member
named empty.

(d) iter->empty() is legal. The expression means check if the string pointed by
iter is empty.

(e) ++*iter is not legal. The expression means increasing value of the element,
but the value is a string and string does not have ++ operator.

(f) iter++->empty() is legal. The expression means move iter to point to the
next element and check if that string is empty.
