with those using a while.
Are there advantages or disadvantages
to using either form?

  For vs. while in C programming?
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2950931/for-vs-while-in-c-programming

  The main difference between the for's and the while's
  is a matter of pragmatics:
  we usually use for when there is a known number of iterations,
  and use while constructs when the number of iterations in not known in
  advance. The while vs do ... while issue is also of pragmatics, the second
  executes the instructions once at start, and afterwards it behaves just like
  the simple while.
