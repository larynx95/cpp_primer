Exercise 1.6:
Explain whether the following program fragment is legal.

std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
          << " and " << v2;
          << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;

If the program is legal, what does it do?
If the program is not legal, why not?
How would you fix it?

#include <iostream>

int main() {
  /*
  not legal because of semicolons
  */
  std::cout << "Enter two numbers:" << std::endl;
  int v1 = 0, v2 = 0;
  std::cin >> v1 >> v2;
  std::cout << "The sum of " << v1 << " and " << v2 << " is " << v1 + v2
            << std::endl;
  return 0;
