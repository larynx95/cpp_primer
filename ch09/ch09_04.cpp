      /* TODO:
      vector elems are stored contiguously to support fast random access.
      What must happen when we add an elem to a vector or a string?
      If there is no room for the new element,
      the container canâ€™t just add an element somewhere else in memory
      - the elements must be contiguous.
      Instead, the container must allocate new memory
      to hold the existing elements plus the new one,
      move the elements from the old location into the new space,
      add the new element, and deallocate the old memory.
      If vector did this memory allocation and deallocation each time
      we added an element, performance would be unacceptably slow.

      To avoid these costs,
      library implementors use allocation strategies
      that reduce the number of times the container is reallocated.
      When they have to get new memory,
      vector and string implementations typically allocate capacity
      beyond what is immediately needed.
      The container holds this storage in reserve
      and uses it to allocate new elements as they are added.
      Thus, there is no need to reallocate the container for each new element.
