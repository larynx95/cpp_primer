Exercise 3.38: In this section, we noted that it was not only illegal but
meaningless to try to add two pointers. Why would adding two pointers be
meaningless?

Answer:
The value of a pointer is the address of the object it points. When adding two
pointers, the result is sum of two address which means an unknown place in
memory. Thus adding two pointers are meaningless.
