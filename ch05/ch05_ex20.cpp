Exercise 5.20: Write a program to read a sequence of strings from the
standard input until either the same word occurs twice in succession or all
the words have been read. Use a while loop to read the text one word at a
time. Use the break statement to terminate the loop if a word occurs twice
in succession. Print the word if it occurs twice in succession, or else print a
message saying that no word was repeated.
