Exercise 5.10: There is one problem with our vowel-counting program as
we’ve implemented it: It doesn’t count capital letters as vowels. Write a
program that counts both lower- and uppercase letters as the appropriate
vowel—that is, your program should count both 'a' and 'A' as part of
aCnt, and so forth.
