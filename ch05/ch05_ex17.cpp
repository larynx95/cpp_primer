Exercise 5.17: Given two vectors of ints, write a program to determine
whether one vector is a prefix of the other. For vectors of unequal
length, compare the number of elements of the smaller vector. For
example, given the vectors containing 0, 1, 1, and 2 and 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5,
8, respectively your program should return true.
